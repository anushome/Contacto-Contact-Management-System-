# Contacto-Contact-Management-System-
This project is all about the contact management system. Here we are managing the content details and credentials of the user.
### Features

1. We can perform basic CRUD operations since we use the database to store the contact details. The user can maintain a different phonebook if they want to create a separate phonebook for family and relatives, or a separate phonebook to store the details about their colleagues.
2. They can perform basic search operations to retrieve data. The search will be based on their first name.
3. We have also made sure that the user should not enter any random values in the details. For example: in the mail and phone field they have to enter a correct value or else it will not create any records. 
4. Last but not the least, if the user wants to send mail to a certain person whose contact details are present in the database then they can use this program to send mails without explicitly opening the browser.
